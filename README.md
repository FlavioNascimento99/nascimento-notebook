# 🧠 My Obsidian Vault - GitHub Edition

Welcome to my personal Obsidian-powered note space 📝

## Why this repo?

I'm tired of note-taking apps that are either too basic or too bloated.  
So I built **my own system** using:

- **Obsidian** – the closest thing to a perfect text editor.
- **Git** – so I can version my thoughts and access them from anywhere.
- **GitHub** – because I don't want to pay for Cloud Sync (sorry, Catalyst 💔).

This repo is my **portable brain** — a bunch of Markdown files I can edit anywhere I log into GitHub.

## What’s inside?

You’ll find:

- 📚 Study notes (Java, Spring Boot, Android Dev, etc.)
- 🧪 Experiments and drafts
- 🔍 Ideas, thoughts, and personal documentation
- 💡 Code snippets, roadmaps, and concepts

All in simple, clean `.md` files — no clutter, no distractions.

## Tech stack

Just the essentials:

- Obsidian
- Git
- Markdown
- A curious mind 😄

## How I use it

- Edit in Obsidian locally
- Push changes to GitHub
- Pull from anywhere (even from a browser)
- Done ✅

But don’t expect polished content — this is raw, honest, and for **me**.
